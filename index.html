        <section id="about1">
            Growing up in an environment with a diverse age group would probably discourage most people from being fascinated by technology, but for me, it drove me in that direction because I was the only one in my family who used computers, and I was frequently responsible for teaching my family how to use the emerging new technologies. Coming of age in the era of social media, I was additionally compelled to use modern technologies as I matured. These are the reasons I decided to pursue a career in software development. üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª

            My main focus in programming at this time is web development. While I love the growth of mobile apps and many now being strong enough to handle most tasks without an external browser, I realize that for many organizations to power an app, they typically start with a website. In addition to my main focus being web development, I also have two side quests in mind, the first being A.I., as predictions show A.I. to be one of the biggest technological advancements of our current 2020s decade. Finally, cybersecurity through code is one of my prominent passions, as the rise of A.I. and other new tech inventions shall bring the need for more creative security measures. üîê

            If I'm not at my computer, I am typically reading, playing golf, or engaging in robotics, specifically researching how to improve robotic animals, who spy on real animals, by infiltrating their habitats safely for both parties.

    <h2>Building a Digital Shopping Cart</h2>
    <p>My final project as a student in Udacity's Introduction to Javascript course was to build an e-commerce shopping cart, with an emphasis on developing the core functionality of the cart. Many objects, arrays, data types, variables, etc. were used in this project. In addition to the three programming languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
